Developed an IoT-based Patient Health Monitoring System using an ESP32 microcontroller to track real-time health parameters, including body temperature, heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen levels (SpO2), room temperature, and humidity. Data is captured from sensors such as MAX30100, DHT11, and DS18B20 and displayed on a web interface accessible via Wi-Fi.

Key Points to Highlight:

Designed and implemented a web server for real-time monitoring of patient health data using ESP32 and WebServer libraries.
Integrated multiple sensors (MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter, DHT11 for temperature and humidity, and DS18B20 for body temperature) for comprehensive health parameter tracking.
Enabled remote access through Wi-Fi, allowing live data monitoring on a user-friendly HTML interface.
Used callbacks for real-time heartbeat detection and reporting.
Ensured modularity and scalability for potential integration with additional sensors or cloud services.
Debugged and validated sensor outputs using serial communication and optimized performance with periodic updates at 1-second intervals.
